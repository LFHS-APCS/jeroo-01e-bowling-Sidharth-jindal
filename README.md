In Jeroo.java, write the method setupBowling() that will put out the pins using flowers with a Jeroo that starts at (0, 0).   

IMPORTANT: Do not put all the code in this one method. You should try to design a more elegant solution with helper methods.  

IMPORTANT:  In your helper methods, you can only use:          
* ```hop()```
* ```plant()```
* ```turn(LEFT)```
* ```turn(RIGHT)```
